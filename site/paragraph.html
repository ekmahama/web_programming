    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>
        Recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicle sensor technology have led to a diverse range of applications for
        unmanned aerial vehicles. Now UAVs are increasingly used in reconnaissance, photography, agriculture, logistics,
        and infrastructure inspection. Research on application of UAVs for bridge inspection is receiving much attention
        due to the economies of scale it brings compared to traditional bridge inspection techniques. Bridges play a
        crucial role in transportation systems. Its reliability and availability have a direct impact on the economy.
        Data from the national bridge inventory shows that there are 616,096 bridges in the United States [1]. About 42
        percent of these were built more than 50 years ago. Since bridges deteriorate with age, proper maintenance is
        required to ensure their structural integrity and safety. Therefore, regular inspection is needed in order to
        draw a proper maintenance plan.
